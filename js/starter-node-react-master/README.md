## Documentation

### Server-side codes with ES6

- `babel-node` is selected in the server-side, 
which is an executable for running code via Babel that otherwise works like the `node` executable.

- `babel-preset-es2015-node5` is selected, so that Babel can transpile ES6.
The preset configures Babel so that only ES6 constructs are transpiled that missing from Node.js 5ã€‚

### Client side codes with ES6 (React with ES6)

Tools:

- **webpack** as a client-side module build and module loader
- **npm** as the package manager
- **Babel** as a transpiler from ES6 to ES5

Dependencies:

- `babel-loader` enables webpack to transpile JavaScript via Babel.
- `babel-preset-es2015` is a Babel preset for compiling ES6 to plain ES6.
- `webpack-dev-server` adds a hot-reloading development web server to webpack.

## Running

### Install dependencies

    npm install
    
### Build

If your app is ready, and you want to check the results, you can execute

    npm run build

then the `bundle.js` is serving at `http://localhost:300/bundle.js` via your koa server, 
or you can use hot mode if you want to `build` repeatedly to check the code changes:

    npm run dev
    
then the `bundle.js` is serving at `http://localhost:8080/assets/bundle.js` via `webpack-dev-server`

**remember!!! you should modify the path of file `bundle.js` in `home.html` manually!**

### Start

    npm start
    
### Browse

Open your browser, and visit `http://localhost:3000` to check the result
